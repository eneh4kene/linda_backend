At what point should the lifestory book artifact be ready/produced?

Good question. There are two triggers:

---

### Trigger 1: Content Threshold (Automatic)

System flags a book as "ready for review" when:

| Criteria | Minimum |
|----------|---------|
| Total starred segments | 12+ |
| Chapters with content | 4+ different categories |
| Total audio duration | 20+ minutes |
| Calls completed | 8+ |

At this point, there's enough material for a meaningful book. Staff gets notified to review and curate.

### Trigger 2: Family Request (Manual)

Family can purchase anytime. If content is thin, you set expectations:

- "We have 6 stories so far — enough for a Starter edition"
- "With a few more weeks of calls, we'll have the full book"

---

### The Uncomfortable Truth

Some residents are in care homes because time is short. You need a "minimum viable book" threshold that's:

- **Low enough** to deliver something if health declines
- **High enough** to feel like a real product

**My recommendation:** 

- **8 quality segments across 3+ chapters = shippable**
- Position early purchases as "Volume 1" with updates included
- Never wait for "complete" — there's no such thing

### Practical Status Flow

```
collecting     →  ready_for_review  →  in_production  →  delivered
(auto)            (threshold met)      (family paid)     (sent)
                         ↓
                  staff curates
                  creates chapters
                  family notified
```

Staff notification: *"Margaret now has 14 story segments across 5 life chapters. Ready to offer the family."*

### When to Pitch the Family

Best timing:
- After 4-6 weeks of calls (enough content)
- Near holidays (Christmas, Mother's Day — gift positioning)
- When resident shares something profound (staff flags it)
- If health changes (urgent but handled sensitively)

Don't wait for perfection. The product is the voice, not the polish.
